- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @amirkamizi
    Many years of work in creative industries such as cinema and animation has helped me in my work in computer programming. 
    Combining the creative vision needed for art, with the structured and algorithmic thinking needed for computer programming has made me a good problem solver.
    Also, the nature of technology, which requires constant learning, fits my character as a learning enthusiast, 
    and this makes me eager to work and advance in computer programming.
